> originally a fork of [fast.js](https://github.com/codemix/fast.js)- implemented with the data to be operated on *last*.
> the structure/project changed enough that the fork was removed (although many functions do still exist).
> additions came from real world usage and inspiration from libraries such as [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda)
> also additions from other collections like [fn] (https://github.com/threepointone/fn).
